The standard ensures the kind of handling one expects from luxury performance cars, and allows you to tailor the yacht to your cruising style. Roll in a standard enclosed hardtop, a deluxe master stateroom and head, and the "open concept" layout of the main accommodation, and you have a water outlet performed very well on all parameters.`,

			`The Meridian is the perfect blend of style and substance. A modern profile is complemented by thoughtful extras onboard. A solid cherry wood interior adds a special elegance. A large entertainment center in the salon is perfect when gathering with friends. Standard Karadon countertops in the galley are both striking and durable. Two large staterooms leave you plenty of space at day's end to stretch out and rest with ease.

      Accommodations
      
      The Meridian has a 2-stateroom layout with the main stateroom forward and 2nd one to starboard.  The full head with shower is to port and rare inside helm station to starboard.  Just aft of the helm is the full galley and leather couch settee to port.  At the entrance to port is the AC/CD panel and battery switch access.  The engine compartment is easily accessed mid cabin with little effort to remove carpet covers and mobile table.  The aft deck has a full enclosure with two access hatches to the bilge where the batteries are housed as well as the generator (inop).  The stairs leading to the flybridge are to starboard and easy maneuverability port and starboard leading to the forward deck.  The flybridge helm station is to starboard with passenger seating to port.  There are canvas covers for the flybridge, forward deck and windshield.`,
